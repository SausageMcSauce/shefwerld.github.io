  If you're reading this, then I've decided to end SKNN due to a lack of interest from me and from others on the SKNN team (expect for SausageMcSauce he is still very enthusiatic about it). I really want to be able to focus on larger projects that I've got going on outside of the tbgs, so sorry for the anti climatic end, Kerbi Adventar was supposed to be the series end.<br><br>
  Carmes, if you want to, you can buy the SKNN division of Shef Werld.
