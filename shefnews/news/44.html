<span id="newsarticle_author">written by Joyous Theta's Disembodied Voice</span><br><br>
As of lately Dreemlenders have been getting ready to step into the shoes of Cod Johnson once more as the much anticipated game Cod 2: The Walleye's Not Good finally releases for the Shefbox Series S. The game takes place after the events of Cod 2: Don't Call Me Junior and so far received high praise from critics, such as a "10/10" from Funny Fake Review Man and a "this isnt call of duty snata why" from John Gameman.

A news repairman has recently gone on the loose, preventing news from being broken everywhere "and not because we've totally run out of ideas." Police have attempted to post a report to help others identify the repairman and get them arrested multiple times but the repairman managed to fix their report before they could break it.

Scientists are currently predicting that all news in the world will be fixed by the repairman on the moment Shef Kerbi ends.

<span id="newsarticle_title">microsoft unveils ms paint 2</span><br>
<span id="newsarticle_author">written by dave saus</span><br><br>
recently, microsoft overlord ill bgates said that the company had plans to compete with valve's half-life alex by developing ms paint 2. I got the chance to talk to mr bgates about the company's plans for the new game. here's my interview!<br><br>

me: hi mr bgates got a minute to talk about ms paint 2?<br>
mr bgates: who are you? how did you get in my house at 2 am?<br>
me: oh sorry I'm an interviewer<br>
mr bgates: oh okay. so what do you want to know?<br>
me: so you said you were taking on the success of valve's half-life alyx. does that mean you're making a vr version?<br>
mr bgates: how do you know about ms paint vr? we weren't supposed to unveil that until after we conquered the world<br>
me: uh I didn't I'm just asking<br>
mr bgates: my bad sorry. uh, no, ms paint 2 isn't vr supported. we want to expand the core base of ms paint while innovating with brand new features.<br>
me: what sort of features are you thinking of adding?<br>
mr bgates: ms paint has always had a strong following since it was first released. we noticed it was very popular around the time of windows xp, so we want to try and bring back some of what made it so exciting back then.<br>
me: interesting. I drew a yin-yang symbol once in ms paint on xp. it was very cool. can I do that in ms paint 2?<br>
mr bgates: yes.<br>
me: can I draw a smiley face in ms paint 2?<br>
mr bgates: yes.<br>
me: can I draw myself in ms paint 2?<br>
mr bgates: yes.<br>
me: can I draw ms paint 2 in ms paint 2?<br>
mr bgates: yes.<br>
me: can I have all your money?<br>
mr bgates: ye- ahhhhhhh, you nearly got me there!<br>
me: ahhh, darn, so close. but anyways, the fans want to know - will ms paint add any new gameplay modes?<br>
mr bgates: absolutely. we recognize ms paint usually gets passed up for other games when people feel like there's not enough to do. so we'll be tweaking some of the features and adding some new ones in.<br>
me: can you tell me one of the new features?<br>
mr bgates: I can't say much but there will definitely be a battle royale mode. 99 ms painters will battle for complete control of mirkosoft wandows. the winner will get credits they can use to unlock new items.<br>
me: how interesting! so does this mean you're shifting away from a single-player experience?<br>
mr bgates: no, there will definitely be singleplayer features in the game. in fact, we're adding a whole new story mode. it's still highly in development, but you can play as one of up to 25 characters.<br>
me: can I draw these characters in ms paint 2?<br>
mr bgates: yes.<br>
me: nice. so you released paint 3d as well. why do you not consider that game to be ms paint 2?<br>
mr bgates: is it called ms paint 2?<br>
me: no it's called paint 3d obviously<br>
mr bgates: well there you go<br>
me: I see<br>
mr bgates: anyways, I should probably go to sleep. but since you're here, would you like some pasta?<br>
me: I don't know, pasta isn't as good after like eight hours since it's been boiled<br>
mr bgates: actually I've been up all night cooking pasta non-stop. I have eighty-three pounds of cooked pasta in my refrigerator.<br>
me: oh, okay!<br><br>

the pasta was very good. anyways so that's the release! I am personally very excited for ms paint 2. microsoft said to stay tuned for more updates, and if you don't see any, to continuously e-mail tim cook about why the iphone x is dumb and the windows phone is good. thanks for reading!

    <span id="newsarticle_author">written by the The New News Generation Machien</span><br><br>
    The long sought after planet, Popstah, was finally discovered this morning by a private scout team hired by the Lucien Alliance. Though the planet is rich with life, the Emperor has stated that He will not be sending any troops to the planet. The Emperor has also stated that the planet shall henceforth be known as 'Jinx'."
    <br><br>
"What?! But it's a stupid name! What if some idiot on the news says it? I'll be mocked forever after all!"<br>
"Everyone knows 'Lucius' and 'Alliance'," the Emperor says with a sigh. "I don't see what the problem is."<br>
"The problem is, they'll make fun of me!"<br>
"No, the problem is you're stupid," the Emperor replies. "Go away, NOW! Go play with your action figures or something. I have work to do."

    <span id="newsarticle_author">written by the The New News Generation Machien</span><br><br>
    The first shots in what is to become a series of skirmishes on the distant planet, Murk were fired today. Two private mercenary groups clashed on the planet, though neither group was from the Empire. Both groups were reportedly made up of ruthless criminals and were fighting for a handful of money and power. Neither group was working for the Empire.
<br><br>
One group, lead by the ruthless bandit leader known as the Troll, was attempting to hold onto their traditional and stolen weapons that they had been issued when hired. These traditionalists are expected to win, as they have the support of the public, who like their familiar weapons, though many would prefer to use an Empire issued weapon.
<br><br>
The other group, lead by a man known as the Beast, was attempting to use their immense technological advantage to gain control of the entire planet. They reportedly had hired out their services to both the criminal factions and various warlords in the hopes of turning the planet into a technological powerhouse that could offer a better front to the Empire.
<br><br>
The public is torn on which group they prefer, as they were equally matched. The Beast has the advantage of being on the Empire's list of most wanted criminals, but the Troll has the traditionalists support.
<br><br>
All eyes are on this conflict to see which group will win. The Troll reportedly has more advanced weapons, but that won't mean anything if he can't make enough of them to replace his lost arms and legs. The Beast reportedly has more powerful weapons, but without the support of the people they'll fall quickly.
